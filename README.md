# empkins-micro

A Python package to analyze EmpkinS Micro data.


## Description

A longer description of the project goes here... (*will follow soon*)


## Installation

To run the code in this repository first install a compatible version of Python (>= 3.8). 
Then, install [poetry](https://python-poetry.org) which is used to manage dependencies and packaging.

Once you installed poetry, run the following commands to clone the repository, initialize a virtual env and install 
all development dependencies:

### MaD Lab Gitlab
With ssh access:

```bash
git clone git@mad-srv.informatik.uni-erlangen.de:empkins/packages/empkins-micro.git
cd empkins-micro
poetry install
```

With https access:

```bash
git clone https://mad-srv.informatik.uni-erlangen.de/empkins/packages/empkins-micro.git
cd empkins-micro
poetry install
```

### GitHub
With ssh access:

```bash
git clone git@github.com:empkins/empkins-micro.git
cd empkins-micro
poetry install
```

With https access:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/empkins/empkins-micro.git
cd empkins-micro
poetry install
```

### Working with the code

**Note**: In order to use jupyter notebooks with the project you need to register a new IPython 
kernel associated with the venv of the project (`poe register_ipykernel` - see below). 
When creating a notebook, make to sure to select this kernel (top right corner of the notebook).

To run any of the tools required for the development workflow, use the `poe` commands of the 
[poethepoet](https://github.com/nat-n/poethepoet) task runner:

```bash
$ poe
docs                 Build the html docs using Sphinx.
format               Reformat all files using black.
format_check         Check, but not change, formatting using black.
lint                 Lint all files with Prospector.
test                 Run Pytest with coverage.
update_version       Bump the version in pyproject.toml and empkins_io.__init__ .
register_ipykernel   Register a new IPython kernel named `empkins-micro` linked to the virtual environment.
remove_ipykernel     Remove the associated IPython kernel.
```

**Note**: The `poe` commands are only available if you are in the virtual environment associated with this project. 
You can either activate the virtual environment manually (e.g., `source .venv/bin/activate`) or use the `poetry shell` 
command to spawn a new shell with the virtual environment activated.

To add new dependencies you need for this repository:
```bash
poetry add <package_name>
```

To update dependencies after the `pyproject.toml` file was changed (It is a good idea to run this after a `git pull`):
```bash
poetry update
```

For more commands see the [official documentation](https://python-poetry.org/docs/cli/).
